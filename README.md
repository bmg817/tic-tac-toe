# Introduction
Welcome to the Phaser Tic Tac Toe game project – a key part of our Dev Log Series: Building a Game for Discord Activities.

Over the past three months, our team at Stone Fruit has launched several casual games tailored for Discord Activities. One of our standout successes, Word Rummy, attracted over 2,000 players in its first month and even generated some revenue. In this series, we're excited to share the insights, lessons learned, and hands-on tips from our journey in building Activity-based video games for Discord.

Discord Activities enable developers to create engaging, interactive experiences that run directly within Discord through embedded web applications. By harnessing this platform, you can build games that integrate seamlessly with Discord’s social features, voice and text chat, and even native monetization options.

This repository features a simple yet fully functional Tic Tac Toe game built using Phaser 3. It serves as a starting point for exploring the development of interactive web games that could be adapted as Discord Activities. Inside, you’ll find all the code you need along with instructions for installation and development.

Happy coding, and we hope this project inspires you to dive into building your own Discord-integrated games!
